La Mer - en - (The Sea)
by Charles Trenet - Translated by Jack Lawrence

The Sea
That one sees dancing along the clear gulfs
Has silver reflections
The Sea
Changing reflections
Under the rain

The Sea
In the summer sky merge
Its white sheep
With such pure angels
The sea, shepherdess of azure
Infinite

See
Close to the ponds
These large wet reeds
See
These white birds
And these rusted houses

The Sea
Has rocked them
Along the clear gulfs
And with a song of love
The Sea
Has soothed my heart for life
