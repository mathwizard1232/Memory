With Apologies to The Who - XKCD 274
by Randall Munroe

People try to shut us d-d-down
Just 'cause our music gets around
Old folks act like total noobs
Get off our net; _you_ block the tubes

Why don't you all just d-d-disconnect
And don't try an' grok our d-d-dialect
I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation
I'm just bloggin' bout my generation
