Rebind windows key to meta in emacs. -- No, maybe figure out how to get wmii/bash/something to stop capturing alt before emacs? or change emacs meta to alt? Test...
Add ability to create id mnumonics [like entropy 1 [also binds] bone [with implications to any other equalities entropy 1 has]]
REM: learn how to spell menumonics when near internet again

Change "Is the following correct" to "Would you like to add the following information to your memory" [equiv shorter version] in order to correctly represent program behavior.

Figure out load balancing correctly to learn two different blocks of data at the same time. Current behavior: in any one session, essentially focus on learning one or the other block.
Desired behavior: ? Thoughts: Perhaps this current system is all right, but should probably have options to mix at random between sequence streams. Later, try to develop more fine-tuned controls. Therefore, re-work structure so
that program is aware of what data is hidden and how it can be sequentially revealed.

Fix users not actually mattering. Currently, a newly created user has access to all data. This shouldn't be.

Ensure that re-adding duplicate knowledge results in no additional cards.

Add the ability to dump to a flat .txt file.
